### Hi, I am Simar ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate student pursuing computer science and exploring multiple domains of the field. I discovered flutter through an interest in front end development. I have written research papers and am currently under the process of writing a paper on cloud technologies. 

ðŸ”­ Cloud Computing and Cyber Security are one of my few intersts.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with Cloud Architects and DevOp enthusiasts.

âš¡ Fun fact: I am obsessed with Formula1 and got to know about AWS from it
