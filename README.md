### Hi, I am Simar ðŸ‘‹

I am an graduate student pursuing computer science at NYU and making advancements in the field of DevSecOps and MLOps. I discovered AWS through Formula1 and was  instantly intrigued and have thereon delved deeper in to cloud tech, DevOps and SecOps. On top of that I have integrated multiple technologies listed to build projects during my first semeseter at NYU. I also have research experience  since I have partaken in writing three research papers over the course of my undergraduate program.

ðŸ”­ Cloud Computing, Machine Learning and Cyber Security are my current interests.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with Cloud Architects and DevOp enthusiasts.

âš¡ Fun fact: I am obsessed with Formula1 and got to know about AWS from it
